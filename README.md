The community-run CMX slack is a collaborative effort of friendly people who want to empower each other to build a stronger, more inclusive community. For the full schpeel, read about the project.

## Why?

This Slack channel was created to be a side-channel for community managers, community support, technical advocates, evangelists and organizers. Generally, we aim to be a place you could go with questions like:

<li>"Hey, who all is going to be at CMX East?"</li>
<li>"What's the best place to buy t-shirts that fit people?"</li>
<li>"Does anyone want to co-sponsor a Meetup?"</li>
<li>"Our Meetup Venue just burned down. Can anyone in Portland host on short notice?"</li>
<li>"What's the best community platform?"</li>
<li>"What are your quarterly goals as a community manager?"</li>
<li>"How much do you travel as an advocate?"</li>
<li>"What is your corporate conference strategy?"</li>
<li>"What sticker design is working best for you right now?"</li>
<li>"I find myself in Chicago and in want of lunch. Anybody hungry?"</li>
<li>"What extent to you copy-edit your blog content?"</li>
<li>"Anybody want a job?"</li>
<li>"Anyone have any advice on starting an Ambassador Program?"</li>
<br>
Questions like those get asked and answered every day, along with a lot of general conversation about advocacy and community management and just plain palling around. Community Management, developer evangelism and advocacy are relatively new roles, so in parallel to the community organization activity, a lot of what goes on in CMX slack is practitioners figuring out what their own roles mean or how to navigate making them work in a new place.

## Who can Join?

Our members are generally professionals with the words 'community', 'advocate', or 'evangelist' in their titles. Organizationally, we usually fall someplace beneath "Product" on the org chart. Right now looking at the active membership, we consist mostly of community and event organizers. Many of our members have a different day job, but organize conferences and/or meetups on the side. We have several others who are students or who do something else professionally and are trying to decide if they're interested in switching roles.

Another thing we have in common is that we're generally incentivized to be cooperative, by which I mean we're very comfortable interacting with, and exchanging information with our contemporaries at competing organizations, and being open about the deficiencies in the technology we advocate compared to competing technology. Despite the religious overtones implied by words like "evangelism", our professional success is inseparable from our credibility and especially among software engineers, our credibility rests on candor, generosity, and sincerity.

## Who can't join?

We've turned down a few membership requests from folks in positions like sales, marketing, and venture capitalism. It's nothing personal, and we don't have anything against those things, but we feel that it's important for us to maintain a certain... simplicity of intention among our members. At the moment CMX slack is genuinely useful as a means of creating ad-hoc dialog between community and advocacy people in a wide range of organizations, and for that to continue and grow, we need to make sure that all of our members are cooperative in nature and both willing and able to help each other out.

That said, we're still figuring out what CMX slack is and what it could be, so by all means if you're coming from a marketing or sales or whatever angle, and you believe that we can help each other, send us an invite request and talk to us.
